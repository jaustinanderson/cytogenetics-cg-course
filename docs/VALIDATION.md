# Validation

## Current status

The v1.1.1 repository baseline has passed local structural, content-contract,
and DOM-level behavior validation. This is a reproducible software result, not
a claim that every scientific statement is correct or that a browser,
accessibility, or rights review has passed.

## Run all committed tests

Requirements: Node.js 20 or newer.

```bash
npm test
```

`npm test` runs the structural validator followed by the DOM behavior suite.
Each can also be run independently:

```bash
npm run validate
npm run test:behavior
```

### Structural and content-contract validator

The structural validator checks:

- document shell and required landmarks
- embedded JavaScript syntax
- absence of the Tailwind browser CDN
- explicit static button types
- unique static DOM IDs
- HTTPS external page resources
- public API version and module count
- all 153 question schemas
- globally unique question IDs
- answer-index bounds
- exact domain and difficulty distributions
- 6 exercise sets / 30 exercise items
- 7 flashcard decks / 61 cards
- 19 image records / 2 embedded / 17 needed
- embedded-image license and redistribution metadata
- quiz and exercise mount resolution
- atomic rejection of malformed and globally duplicate injected questions

### DOM behavior suite

`tests/dom-behavior.mjs` boots the real inline course script inside the minimal,
dependency-free fixture in `tests/dom-harness.mjs`. Its 36 checks cover:

- rendering of all declared quiz, exercise, flashcard, and schematic mounts
- generated sidebar/dashboard navigation and mobile open/close state
- correct and incorrect quiz behavior, item locking, feedback, and stable IDs
- exercise answering, scoring, advancing, and completion
- module completion, v1-to-v2 migration, storage, and simulated reload
- UI Reset from v1-only, migrated, and v2-only states
- API Reset, import/export, print hooks, public API methods, events, and
  analytics
- runtime question injection and safe handling of markup characters as text
- implemented accessibility affordances: landmarks, skip link, focus-visible
  and reduced-motion CSS, `aria-expanded`, typed controls, and keyboard-
  operable flashcards

The suite was independently mutation-checked. Deliberately breaking migration,
legacy Reset cleanup, answer recording, or import-version validation caused the
expected checks to fail.

The harness is not a browser. It cannot establish rendering, layout, color
contrast, real focus behavior, touch input, networking, or screen-reader
output. CI runs `npm test` on pushes to `main` and pull requests.

## Deployed smoke test — 2026-07-30

Verified URL:
<https://jaustinanderson.github.io/cytogenetics-cg-course/>

Observed:

- page title and course hero rendered correctly
- custom CSS rendered without Tailwind
- all 17 quiz mounts rendered
- all 6 exercise sets rendered
- the hero correctly displayed 6 interactive exercises
- a correct quiz answer produced the expected feedback
- marking Module 1 complete updated the UI
- Module 1 completion survived a full page reload
- no page-origin console warning or error was recorded

The cloud test browser did not complete either third-party image request, so
successful delivery of the Wikimedia and CDC images was not established by this
test. The page itself emitted no image error, and source links/fallback content
remain present. Asset localization is still an open roadmap decision.

## Independently run HTML validation

The initial repository hardening was also checked with:

```bash
npm exec --yes --package=html-validate@10.4.0 -- html-validate index.html
```

That tool is intentionally not a runtime or committed package dependency.

## Gates not yet automated in a real browser

### Browser behavior

The DOM suite covers the core logic paths above. Still required in a real
browser:

- repeatable deployed-page tests with page-origin console assertions
- scroll-driven active-section highlighting
- real reload/storage behavior
- print rendering
- narrow-screen and touch navigation
- confirmation that the two third-party images load or fall back

### Accessibility

The DOM suite checks only the implemented static and keyboard affordances listed
above.

Still required:

- Escape and focus behavior for the mobile sidebar
- hidden/inert navigation state
- live announcements for results and completion
- accessible names for instructional SVGs
- flashcard front/back screen-reader state
- contrast remediation for faint/accent text
- automated scan and representative screen-reader review

### Scientific review

Required before release qualification:

- exact source record
- authoritative-source check
- Austin's subject-matter review
- review date and status
- edition/SOP sensitivity where applicable

### Rights review

Required per image or other third-party asset:

- source and creator
- exact license or public-domain basis
- verification date
- attribution
- modification status
- redistribution decision

## Release language

Use:

> Structurally validated beta; full scientific and accessibility review is in
> progress.

Do not use:

> Validated CG(ASCP) course

unless the validation scope is immediately and unambiguously qualified.
