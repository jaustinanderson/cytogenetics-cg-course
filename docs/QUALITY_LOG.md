# Quality Log

This log records documentable failures in reasoning, implementation, or
planning. Each entry includes the diagnosis, correction, and prevention measure.

## QL-001 — Development-only dependency in the distributable artifact

- **Status:** Corrected in v1.1.1
- **Finding:** The page loaded Tailwind's browser CDN even though all production
  styling used custom CSS.
- **Impact:** A production console warning, unnecessary third-party executable
  code, extra privacy/supply-chain exposure, and misleading architecture.
- **Cause:** A prototyping dependency survived after its utilities were no
  longer used.
- **Correct action:** Remove the script and validate visual/structural behavior.
- **Correction:** Removed the CDN script; JavaScript and HTML validation pass.
- **Prevention:** Inventory every external runtime dependency and fail browser
  smoke tests on unexpected console output.

## QL-002 — Documentation overstated API validation

- **Status:** Core contract corrected in v1.1.1; broader API review remains open
- **Finding:** The roadmap said `addQuestions()` validated the full schema and
  rejected duplicates, but implementation checked only a few fields and only
  deduplicated within one quiz.
- **Impact:** Malformed content and cross-quiz duplicate IDs could enter memory;
  duplicate IDs could corrupt analytics indexing.
- **Cause:** Documentation described intended behavior rather than tested
  behavior.
- **Correct action:** Treat public API statements as contracts and prove them.
- **Correction:** Added full core-schema checks, answer bounds, recognized
  domains/difficulties, global duplicate detection, atomic rejection, and tests.
- **Prevention:** Every public API guarantee requires a committed contract test.

## QL-003 — Reset could resurrect migrated progress

- **Status:** Corrected in v1.1.1
- **Finding:** UI Reset removed v2 state but left the v1 migration source.
- **Impact:** Reload could re-import old module completion immediately after the
  user chose to erase it.
- **Cause:** Reset was designed around current storage without testing the full
  migration lifecycle.
- **Correct action:** Clear both keys or use a tested migration tombstone.
- **Correction:** UI and API Reset now clear the legacy key.
- **Prevention:** Test Reset from fresh, v1-only, migrated, and v2-only states.

## QL-004 — Historical validation claim was not reproducible

- **Status:** Structural and DOM-behavior instruments committed; real-browser,
  scientific, rights, and full accessibility layers remain open
- **Finding:** The archived roadmap described a runtime harness that was not
  included with the supplied project.
- **Impact:** Readers could not reproduce the evidence behind the claim.
- **Cause:** Validation results were recorded without committing the instrument.
- **Correct action:** Commit tests and distinguish structural, behavioral,
  scientific, accessibility, and rights validation.
- **Correction:** Added a committed structural/content validator, a
  dependency-free DOM behavior harness, mutation checks, and CI.
- **Prevention:** No validation claim without the command, instrument, scope, and
  exact result in the repository.

## QL-005 — Exercise progress identity is position-dependent

- **Status:** Open; Milestone 1
- **Finding:** Exercise outcomes use IDs such as `ex7-1`, derived from array
  position.
- **Impact:** Inserting or reordering exercise items can attach saved history to
  a different item.
- **Cause:** Presentation order was used as persistent identity.
- **Correct action:** Give each item a stable explicit ID and migrate existing
  position-based records.
- **Prevention:** Any persistable entity must have an order-independent identity
  and a migration test.

## QL-006 — Progress import trusts malformed nested state

- **Status:** Open; Milestone 1
- **Finding:** `importJSON()` checks schema version but does not fully validate
  nested maps and outcome records.
- **Impact:** Malformed imported data can break later operations or distort
  headline analytics.
- **Cause:** Version compatibility was treated as structural validity.
- **Correct action:** Validate, normalize, and deep-clone imported state; define
  handling for stale IDs.
- **Prevention:** Add hostile/malformed import fixtures and round-trip tests.

## QL-007 — A test instrument produced a false defect report

- **Status:** Corrected before any product change was made
- **Finding:** The new DOM harness initially reported that dynamically created
  exercise option buttons lacked `type="button"`. The course correctly sets
  `button.type = "button"`; the harness did not yet reflect that property to the
  underlying attribute as a browser does.
- **Impact:** None shipped. Trusting the report would have produced a pointless
  product edit and a changelog entry for a defect that did not exist.
- **Cause:** A partial DOM fixture was briefly treated as an oracle before its
  browser-model fidelity was checked.
- **Correct action:** Confirm unexpected findings against product source and a
  real browser before changing the product.
- **Correction:** Added `type` property/attribute reflection and correct
  text-to-`innerHTML` escaping to the harness; `index.html` was not modified.
- **Prevention:** Keep harness scope limits explicit, mutation-check critical
  paths, and add fixture-fidelity assertions when a product behavior depends on
  a modeled browser contract.
